            <h2>Why Japan</h2>
            <h3>Japan, the land of Cherry Blossoms</h3>
            <p>
              Hanami (花見, "flower viewing") is the Japanese traditional custom
              of enjoying the transient beauty of flowers; flowers (花, hana) in
              this case almost always refer to those of the cherry (桜, sakura)
              or, less frequently, plum (梅, ume) trees. From the end of March
              to early May, cherry trees bloom all over Japan, and around the
              second week of January on the island of Okinawa. The blossom
              forecast (桜前線, sakura-zensen) "cherry blossom front" is
              announced each year by the Japan Meteorological Agency, and is
              watched carefully by those planning hanami as the blossoms only
              last a week or two.
            </p>
            <p>
              In modern-day Japan, hanami mostly consists of having an outdoor
              party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. In some
              contexts the Sino-Japanese term kan'ō (観桜, view-cherry) is used
              instead, particularly for festivals. Hanami at night is called
              yozakura (夜桜) "night sakura". In many places such as Ueno Park
              temporary paper lanterns are hung for the purpose of yozakura. On
              the island of Okinawa, decorative electric lanterns are hung in
              the trees for evening enjoyment, such as on the trees ascending
              Mt. Yae, near Motobu Town, or at the Nakijin Castle. A more
              ancient form of hanami also exists in Japan, which is enjoying the
              plum blossoms instead, which is narrowly referred to as umemi
              (梅見, plum-viewing). This kind of hanami is popular among older
              people, because they are calmer than the sakura parties, which
              usually involve younger people and can sometimes be very crowded
              and noisy.

                <p>
                  Kinkakuji (金閣寺, Golden Pavilion) is a Zen temple in
                  northern Kyoto whose top two floors are completely covered in
                  gold leaf. Kinkakuji is an impressive structure built
                  overlooking a large pond, and is the only building left of
                  Yoshimitsu's former retirement complex. It has burned down
                  numerous times throughout its history including twice during
                  the Onin War, a civil war that destroyed much of Kyoto; and
                  once again more recently in 1950 when it was set on fire by a
                  fanatic monk. The present structure was rebuilt in 1955.

                <p>
                  Shinsekai is an old neighborhood that was modeled after 2
                  cities, New York for its southern half and Paris for its
                  northern half. Although in the 1990s it had a reputation as a
                  dangerous place to be, it's streets are much more tranquil.
                  Shinsekai boasts a colourful history and unique identity. It's
                  the ideal place to see a vibrant, somewhat edgier side of
                  Japan.
