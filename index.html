            <h2>Why Japan</h2>
            <h3>Japan, the land of Cherry Blossoms</h3>
            <p>
              Hanami (花見, "flower viewing") is the Japanese traditional custom
              of enjoying the transient beauty of flowers; flowers (花, hana) in
              this case almost always refer to those of the cherry (桜, sakura)
              or, less frequently, plum (梅, ume) trees. From the end of March
              to early May, cherry trees bloom all over Japan, and around the
              second week of January on the island of Okinawa. The blossom
              forecast (桜前線, sakura-zensen) "cherry blossom front" is
              announced each year by the Japan Meteorological Agency, and is
              watched carefully by those planning hanami as the blossoms only
              last a week or two.
            </p>
            <p>
              In modern-day Japan, hanami mostly consists of having an outdoor
              party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. In some
              contexts the Sino-Japanese term kan'ō (観桜, view-cherry) is used
              instead, particularly for festivals. Hanami at night is called
              yozakura (夜桜) "night sakura". In many places such as Ueno Park
              temporary paper lanterns are hung for the purpose of yozakura. On
              the island of Okinawa, decorative electric lanterns are hung in
              the trees for evening enjoyment, such as on the trees ascending
              Mt. Yae, near Motobu Town, or at the Nakijin Castle. A more
              ancient form of hanami also exists in Japan, which is enjoying the
              plum blossoms instead, which is narrowly referred to as umemi
              (梅見, plum-viewing). This kind of hanami is popular among older
              people, because they are calmer than the sakura parties, which
              usually involve younger people and can sometimes be very crowded
              and noisy.
